You don‚Äôt get to visit feed lots or visit slaughterhouses,‚Äù Valeti tells me.\nValeti imagines a production facility that looks more like a craft brewery than a slaughterhouse. It also would represent the first major innovation in the meat industry in the 10,000 years since humans first began breeding livestock.\nIn a 2002 article for The New York Times Magazine, journalist Michael Pollan¬†described how cows are slaughtered.¬†\nThe cows are funneled into a chute single-file. Once there, they are walked over a metal bar, and, as the floor declines, the cows are suspended over a false floor on the bar and then taken on a conveyor belt to pass in front of a slaughterhouse employee called a ‚Äústunner.‚Äù\nThe stunner‚Äôs job is to shoot a seven-inch steel bolt, roughly the width of a pencil, between the eyes of the drugged and incapacitated cow.\nThen the dead animal is moved from the conveyor belt to a trolley overhead and carried to the bleeding area, where its throat is cut.¬†Roughly 392 cows are slaughtered per hour at a typical slaughterhouse (like the one in Kansas that Pollan described).\nThis is the culmination of human achievement in meat processing so far (don‚Äôt even get me started on chickens).\n"], ["author", "TechCrunch"], ["tags", "Billionaires, Ventures"], ["created_at", "2019-01-10 01:43:13.711555"], ["updated_at", "2019-01-10 01:43:13.711555"]]

But no matter the reason, most cyclists will ride on the road at some point, and when they do, they‚Äôll think about the safety and comfort of their route.\nShould you take a longer route to ride on a road with a dedicated cycling lane? Do you take a left turn to avoid those difficult hills? Different cyclists will make different choices, as the ideal route for one bicyclist may not be so ideal for another.\nValhalla, the open-source routing engine that powers¬†Mapzen Turn-by-Turn, has always had customization parameters.

Not only is overall routing improved, but¬†use_roads¬†and¬†use_hillsare now much more versatile: when both of these parameters are set to 0, Valhalla generates a nice, ‚Äúlow-stress‚Äù biking route.

However, after doing this, we realized that the algorithms of the new¬†LowStressBicycleCost¬†class were actually cleaner and easier to manage than our original bike costing algorithms. This inspried us to rewrite the old bike code to look like the new low-stress bike code. This way, the¬†use_roads¬†and¬†use_hills¬†parameters acted as variables that scale the costs of edges (i.e. road segments) with particular attributes in a way that provides low-stress biking at one end of the spectrum, and professional road biking on the other.\nWhen originally making the¬†LowStressBicycleCost¬†class, we made use of research by¬†Michael B.

This provides access to endless C libraries, the Standard C runtime library, and of course the operating system APIs, which are usually C APIs.\nBut there‚Äôs much more to C than that. There are large and immensely useful programs written in C, such as the Linux operating system and a very large chunk of the programs written for it. While D programs can interface with C libraries, the reverse isn‚Äôt true. C programs cannot interface with D ones. It‚Äôs not possible (at least not without considerable effort) to compile a couple of D files and link them in to a C program. The trouble is that compiled D files refer to things that only exist in the D runtime library, and linking that in (it‚Äôs a bit large) tends to be impractical.\nD code also can‚Äôt exist in a program unless D controls the¬†main()¬†function, which is how the startup code in the D runtime library is managed. Hence D libraries remain inaccessible to C programs, and chimera programs (a mix of C and D) are not practical. One cannot pragmatically ‚Äútry out‚Äù D by add D modules to an existing C program.\nThat is, until Better C came along.\nIt‚Äôs been done before, it‚Äôs an old idea. Bjarne Stroustrup wrote a paper in 1988 entitled ‚ÄúA Better C‚Äú. His early C++ compiler was able to compile C code pretty much unchanged, and then one could start using C++ features here and there as they made sense, all without disturbing the existing investment in C. This was a brilliant strategy, and drove the early success of C++.\nA more modern example is Kotlin, which uses a different method. Kotlin syntax is not compatible with Java, but it is fully interoperable with Java, relies on the existing Java libraries, and allows a gradual migration of Java code to¬†Kotlin. Kotlin is indeed a ‚ÄúBetter Java‚Äù, and this shows in its success.\nD as Better C\nD takes a radically different approach to making a better C. It is not an extension of C, it is not a superset of C, and does not bring along C‚Äôs longstanding issues (such as the preprocessor, array overflows, etc.). D‚Äôs solution is to subset the D language, removing or altering features that require the D startup code and runtime library. This is, simply, the charter of the¬†-betterC¬†compiler switch.\nDoesn‚Äôt removing things from D make it no longer D? That‚Äôs a hard question to answer, and it‚Äôs really a matter of individual preference. The vast bulk of the core language remains. Certainly the D characteristics that are analogous to C remain. The result is a language somewhere in between C and D, but that is fully upward compatible with D.\nRemoved Things\nMost obviously, the garbage collector is removed, along with the features that depend on the garbage collector. Memory can still be allocated the same way as in C ‚Äì using¬†malloc()¬†or some custom allocator.\nAlthough C++ classes and COM classes will still work, D polymorphic classes will not, as they rely on the garbage collector.\nExceptions, typeid, static construction/destruction, RAII, and unittests are removed. But it is possible we can find ways to add them back in.\nAsserts are altered to call the C runtime library assert fail functions rather than the D runtime library ones.\n(This isn‚Äôt a complete list, for that see¬†http://dlang.org/dmd-windows.html#switch-betterC.)\nRetained Things\nMore importantly, what remains?\nWhat may be initially most important to C programmers is memory safety in the form of array overflow checking, no more stray pointers into expired stack frames, and guaranteed initialization of locals.

My response was as follows:\nDear Matthias,\nyou are right Racket is so much better in so many dimensions. I use Lisp because I just can't bear programming in a language without proper syntactic abstraction, and that is a dimension where Racket is far ahead of Common Lisp (CL), which sadly also remains far ahead of the rest of competition. Racket also has managed to grow a remarkable way to mix typed and untyped program fragments, which sets it ahead of most. But I am under the impression that there are still many dimensions in which Racket lags behind other languages and Common Lisp (CL) in particular.\n\t1.\tThe Common Lisp Object System (CLOS) has multiple-inheritance, multi-methods, method combinations, introspection and extensibility via the MOP, generic functions that work on builtin classes, support for dynamic instance class change (change-class, update-instance-for-changed-class) and class redefinition (defclass, update-instance-for-redefined-class), a semi-decent story for combining parametric polymorphism and ad hoc polymorphism (my own lisp-interface-library), etc. Racket seems to still be playing catch-up with respect to ad hoc polymorphism, and is lacking a set of good data structure libraries that take advantage of both functional and object-oriented programming (a good target is Scala's scalaz or its rival cats).\n\t2.\tWhile the ubiquity of global side-effects in CL is very bad, the facts that all objects that matter are addressable by a path from some global namespace and that live redefinition is actively supported makes debugging and maintaining long-lived systems with in-image persistent data more doable (see again CLOS's update-instance-for-redefined-class). This is in contrast with the Racket IDE which drops live data when you recompile the code, which is fine for student exercises, but probably wrong for live systems. CL is one of the few languages that takes long-term data seriously (though not quite as seriously as Erlang).\n\t3.\tLibraries. CL seems to have much more libraries than Racket, and though the quality varies, these libraries seem to often have more feature coverage and more focus on production quality. From a cursory look, Racket libraries seem to often stop at \"good enough for demo\". An effort on curating libraries, homogenizing namespaces, etc., could also help Racket (I consider CL rather bad in this respect, yet Racket seems worse). My recent experience with acmart, my first maintained Racket library, makes me think that writing libraries is even higher overhead in Racket than in CL, which is already mediocre.\n\t4.\tSpeedwise, SBCL still produces code that runs noticeably faster than Racket (as long as you don't need full delimited control, which would requires a much slower CL-to-CL compiler like hu.dwim.delico). This difference may be reduced as Racket adopts the notoriously fast Chez Scheme as a backend (or not). Actually, the announcement of the new Racket backend really makes me eager to jump ship.\n\t5.\tAs for startup latency, Common Lisp is also pretty good with its saved images (they start in tens of milliseconds on my laptop), making it practical to write trivial utilities for interactive use from the shell command-line with an \"instantaneous\" feel. Racket takes hundreds of milliseconds at startup which puts it (barely) in the \"noticeable delay\" category (though nowhere near as bad as anything JVM-based).\nAll these reasons, in addition to inertia (and a non-negligible code-base and mind-base), have made me stick to CL ‚Äî for now. I think Racket is the future of Lisp (at least for me), I just haven't jumped ship right yet. If and when I do, I'll probably be working on some of these issues.\nPS (still 2017-03): Here are ways that Racket is indeed vastly superior to CL, that make me believe it's the future of Lisp:\n\t‚Ä¢\tFirst and foremost, Racket keeps evolving, and not just \"above\" the base language, but importantly¬†below. This alone makes it vastly superior to CL (that has evolved tremendously \"above\" its base abstractions, but hasn't evolved \"below\", except for FFI purpose, in the last 20 years), which itself remains superior to most languages (that tend to not evolve much \"above\", and not at all \"below\" their base abstractions).\n\t‚Ä¢\tRacket is by far ahead of the pack in terms of Syntactic abstraction. It is the best language in which to define other languages and experiment with them, bar none.\n\t‚Ä¢\tRacket has a decent module system, including build and phase separation (even separate phases for testing, cross-compilation or whatever you want), and symbol selection and renaming.\n\t‚Ä¢\tRacket has typed modules, and a good interface between typed and untyped modules. While types in Racket do not compete with those of say Haskell, just yet, they are still evolving, fast, and that contract interface between typed and untyped is far ahead of anything the competition has.\n\t‚Ä¢\tRacket has lots of great teaching material.\n\t‚Ä¢\tRacket has a one-stop-shop for documentation, though it isn't always easy to navigate and often lack examples. That still puts it far ahead of CL and a lot of languages.\n\t‚Ä¢\tRacket provides purity by default a decent set of data structures.\n\t‚Ä¢\tRacket has many primitives for concurrency, virtualization, sandboxing.\n\t‚Ä¢\tRacket has standard primitives for laziness, pattern-matching, etc.\n\t‚Ä¢\tRacket has a standard, portable, gui.\n\t‚Ä¢\tRacket has a lively, healthy, user and developer community.\n"], ["author", "Live Journal"], ["tags", "Lisp, Racket"], ["created_at", "2019-01-10 01:43:13.726733"], ["updated_at", "2019-01-10 01:43:13.726733"]]

In some situations where it seems as though waves should advance freely, they just stop ‚Äî like a tsunami halting in the middle of the ocean.\nAnderson won the 1977 Nobel Prize in physics for his discovery of what is now called Anderson localization, a term that refers to waves that stay in some ‚Äúlocal‚Äù region rather than propagating the way you‚Äôd expect. He studied the phenomenon in the context of electrons moving through impure materials (electrons behave as both particles and waves), but under certain circumstances it can happen with other types of waves as well.\nEven after Anderson‚Äôs discovery, much about localization remained mysterious. Although researchers were able to prove that localization does indeed occur, they had a very limited ability to predict when and where it might happen. It was as if you were standing on one side of a room, expecting a sound wave to reach your ear, but it never did. Even if, after Anderson, you knew that the reason it didn‚Äôt was that it had localized somewhere on its way, you‚Äôd still like to figure out exactly where it had gone. And for decades, that‚Äôs what mathematicians and physicists struggled to explain.\nThis is where¬†Svitlana Mayboroda¬†comes in. Mayboroda, 36, is a mathematician at the University of Minnesota. Five years ago, she began to untangle the long-standing puzzle of localization. She came up with a mathematical formula called the ‚Äúlandscape function‚Äù that predicts exactly where waves will localize and what form they‚Äôll take when they do.\n‚ÄúYou want to know how to find these areas of localization,‚Äù Mayboroda said. ‚ÄúThe naive approach is difficult. The landscape function magically gives a way of doing it.‚Äù\nHer work began in the realm of pure mathematics, but unlike most mathematical advances, which might find a practical use after decades, if ever, her work is already being applied by physicists. In particular, LED lights ‚Äî or light-emitting diodes ‚Äî depend on the phenomenon of localization. They light up when electrons in a semiconducting material, having started out in a position of higher energy, get trapped (or ‚Äúlocalize‚Äù) in a position of lower energy and emit the difference as a photon of light. LEDs are still a work in progress: Engineers need to build LEDs that more efficiently convert electrons into light, if the devices are to become the future of artificial lighting, as many expect they will. If physicists can gain a better understanding of the mathematics of localization, engineers can build better LEDs ‚Äî and with the help of Mayboroda‚Äôs mathematics, that effort is already under way.\nRogue Waves\nLocalization is not an intuitive concept. Imagine you stood on one side of a room and watched someone ring a bell, only the sound never reached your ears. Now imagine that the reason it didn‚Äôt is that the sound had fallen into an architectural trap, like the sound of the sea bottled in a shell.\n"], ["author", "Quanta Magazine"], ["tags", "Mathematicians, LED"], ["created_at", "2019-01-10 01:43:13.731202"], ["updated_at", "2019-01-10 01:43:13.731202"]]

But no matter the reason, most cyclists will ride on the road at some point, and when they do, they‚Äôll think about the safety and comfort of their route.\nShould you take a longer route to ride on a road with a dedicated cycling lane? Do you take a left turn to avoid those difficult hills? Different cyclists will make different choices, as the ideal route for one bicyclist may not be so ideal for another.\nValhalla, the open-source routing engine that powers¬†Mapzen Turn-by-Turn, has always had customization parameters. While these include¬†use_roads¬†and¬†use_hills, setting these to zero didn‚Äôt quite define what most would consider a ‚Äúlow stress‚Äù bike route. At least not until now!\nThis summer, I and the Mapzen routing team enhanced Valhalla‚Äôs bicycle costing system. Not only is overall routing improved, but¬†use_roads¬†and¬†use_hillsare now much more versatile: when both of these parameters are set to 0, Valhalla generates a nice, ‚Äúlow-stress‚Äù biking route.

Our original goal was to introduce a new ‚Äúlow-stress bike‚Äù costing class derived from the regular bike costing class. However, after doing this, we realized that the algorithms of the new¬†LowStressBicycleCost¬†class were actually cleaner and easier to manage than our original bike costing algorithms. This inspried us to rewrite the old bike code to look like the new low-stress bike code. This way, the¬†use_roads¬†and¬†use_hills¬†parameters acted as variables that scale the costs of edges (i.e. road segments) with particular attributes in a way that provides low-stress biking at one end of the spectrum, and professional road biking on the other.\nWhen originally making the¬†LowStressBicycleCost¬†class, we made use of research by¬†Michael B.

This provides access to endless C libraries, the Standard C runtime library, and of course the operating system APIs, which are usually C APIs.\nBut there‚Äôs much more to C than that. There are large and immensely useful programs written in C, such as the Linux operating system and a very large chunk of the programs written for it. While D programs can interface with C libraries, the reverse isn‚Äôt true. C programs cannot interface with D ones. It‚Äôs not possible (at least not without considerable effort) to compile a couple of D files and link them in to a C program. The trouble is that compiled D files refer to things that only exist in the D runtime library, and linking that in (it‚Äôs a bit large) tends to be impractical.\nD code also can‚Äôt exist in a program unless D controls the¬†main()¬†function, which is how the startup code in the D runtime library is managed. Hence D libraries remain inaccessible to C programs, and chimera programs (a mix of C and D) are not practical. One cannot pragmatically ‚Äútry out‚Äù D by add D modules to an existing C program.\nThat is, until Better C came along.\nIt‚Äôs been done before, it‚Äôs an old idea. Bjarne Stroustrup wrote a paper in 1988 entitled ‚ÄúA Better C‚Äú. His early C++ compiler was able to compile C code pretty much unchanged, and then one could start using C++ features here and there as they made sense, all without disturbing the existing investment in C. This was a brilliant strategy, and drove the early success of C++.\nA more modern example is Kotlin, which uses a different method. Kotlin syntax is not compatible with Java, but it is fully interoperable with Java, relies on the existing Java libraries, and allows a gradual migration of Java code to¬†Kotlin. Kotlin is indeed a ‚ÄúBetter Java‚Äù, and this shows in its success.\nD as Better C\nD takes a radically different approach to making a better C. It is not an extension of C, it is not a superset of C, and does not bring along C‚Äôs longstanding issues (such as the preprocessor, array overflows, etc.). D‚Äôs solution is to subset the D language, removing or altering features that require the D startup code and runtime library. This is, simply, the charter of the¬†-betterC¬†compiler switch.\nDoesn‚Äôt removing things from D make it no longer D? That‚Äôs a hard question to answer, and it‚Äôs really a matter of individual preference. The vast bulk of the core language remains. Certainly the D characteristics that are analogous to C remain. The result is a language somewhere in between C and D, but that is fully upward compatible with D.\nRemoved Things\nMost obviously, the garbage collector is removed, along with the features that depend on the garbage collector. Memory can still be allocated the same way as in C ‚Äì using¬†malloc()¬†or some custom allocator.\nAlthough C++ classes and COM classes will still work, D polymorphic classes will not, as they rely on the garbage collector.\nExceptions, typeid, static construction/destruction, RAII, and unittests are removed. But it is possible we can find ways to add them back in.\nAsserts are altered to call the C runtime library assert fail functions rather than the D runtime library ones.\n(This isn‚Äôt a complete list, for that see¬†http://dlang.org/dmd-windows.html#switch-betterC.)\nRetained Things\nMore importantly, what remains?\nWhat may be initially most important to C programmers is memory safety in the form of array overflow checking, no more stray pointers into expired stack frames, and guaranteed initialization of locals.

My response was as follows:\nDear Matthias,\nyou are right Racket is so much better in so many dimensions. I use Lisp because I just can't bear programming in a language without proper syntactic abstraction, and that is a dimension where Racket is far ahead of Common Lisp (CL), which sadly also remains far ahead of the rest of competition. Racket also has managed to grow a remarkable way to mix typed and untyped program fragments, which sets it ahead of most. But I am under the impression that there are still many dimensions in which Racket lags behind other languages and Common Lisp (CL) in particular.\n\t1.\tThe Common Lisp Object System (CLOS) has multiple-inheritance, multi-methods, method combinations, introspection and extensibility via the MOP, generic functions that work on builtin classes, support for dynamic instance class change (change-class, update-instance-for-changed-class) and class redefinition (defclass, update-instance-for-redefined-class), a semi-decent story for combining parametric polymorphism and ad hoc polymorphism (my own lisp-interface-library), etc. Racket seems to still be playing catch-up with respect to ad hoc polymorphism, and is lacking a set of good data structure libraries that take advantage of both functional and object-oriented programming (a good target is Scala's scalaz or its rival cats).\n\t2.\tWhile the ubiquity of global side-effects in CL is very bad, the facts that all objects that matter are addressable by a path from some global namespace and that live redefinition is actively supported makes debugging and maintaining long-lived systems with in-image persistent data more doable (see again CLOS's update-instance-for-redefined-class). This is in contrast with the Racket IDE which drops live data when you recompile the code, which is fine for student exercises, but probably wrong for live systems. CL is one of the few languages that takes long-term data seriously (though not quite as seriously as Erlang).\n\t3.\tLibraries. CL seems to have much more libraries than Racket, and though the quality varies, these libraries seem to often have more feature coverage and more focus on production quality. From a cursory look, Racket libraries seem to often stop at \"good enough for demo\". An effort on curating libraries, homogenizing namespaces, etc., could also help Racket (I consider CL rather bad in this respect, yet Racket seems worse). My recent experience with acmart, my first maintained Racket library, makes me think that writing libraries is even higher overhead in Racket than in CL, which is already mediocre.\n\t4.\tSpeedwise, SBCL still produces code that runs noticeably faster than Racket (as long as you don't need full delimited control, which would requires a much slower CL-to-CL compiler like hu.dwim.delico). This difference may be reduced as Racket adopts the notoriously fast Chez Scheme as a backend (or not). Actually, the announcement of the new Racket backend really makes me eager to jump ship.\n\t5.\tAs for startup latency, Common Lisp is also pretty good with its saved images (they start in tens of milliseconds on my laptop), making it practical to write trivial utilities for interactive use from the shell command-line with an \"instantaneous\" feel. Racket takes hundreds of milliseconds at startup which puts it (barely) in the \"noticeable delay\" category (though nowhere near as bad as anything JVM-based).\nAll these reasons, in addition to inertia (and a non-negligible code-base and mind-base), have made me stick to CL ‚Äî for now. I think Racket is the future of Lisp (at least for me), I just haven't jumped ship right yet. If and when I do, I'll probably be working on some of these issues.\nPS (still 2017-03): Here are ways that Racket is indeed vastly superior to CL, that make me believe it's the future of Lisp:\n\t‚Ä¢\tFirst and foremost, Racket keeps evolving, and not just \"above\" the base language, but importantly¬†below. This alone makes it vastly superior to CL (that has evolved tremendously \"above\" its base abstractions, but hasn't evolved \"below\", except for FFI purpose, in the last 20 years), which itself remains superior to most languages (that tend to not evolve much \"above\", and not at all \"below\" their base abstractions).\n\t‚Ä¢\tRacket is by far ahead of the pack in terms of Syntactic abstraction. It is the best language in which to define other languages and experiment with them, bar none.\n\t‚Ä¢\tRacket has a decent module system, including build and phase separation (even separate phases for testing, cross-compilation or whatever you want), and symbol selection and renaming.\n\t‚Ä¢\tRacket has typed modules, and a good interface between typed and untyped modules. While types in Racket do not compete with those of say Haskell, just yet, they are still evolving, fast, and that contract interface between typed and untyped is far ahead of anything the competition has.\n\t‚Ä¢\tRacket has lots of great teaching material.\n\t‚Ä¢\tRacket has a one-stop-shop for documentation, though it isn't always easy to navigate and often lack examples. That still puts it far ahead of CL and a lot of languages.\n\t‚Ä¢\tRacket provides purity by default a decent set of data structures.\n\t‚Ä¢\tRacket has many primitives for concurrency, virtualization, sandboxing.\n\t‚Ä¢\tRacket has standard primitives for laziness, pattern-matching, etc.\n\t‚Ä¢\tRacket has a standard, portable, gui.\n\t‚Ä¢\tRacket has a lively, healthy, user and developer community.\n"], ["author", "Live Journal"], ["tags", "Lisp, Racket"], ["created_at", "2019-01-11 04:12:09.421568"], ["updated_at", "2019-01-11 04:12:09.421568"]]

In some situations where it seems as though waves should advance freely, they just stop ‚Äî like a tsunami halting in the middle of the ocean.\nAnderson won the 1977 Nobel Prize in physics for his discovery of what is now called Anderson localization, a term that refers to waves that stay in some ‚Äúlocal‚Äù region rather than propagating the way you‚Äôd expect. He studied the phenomenon in the context of electrons moving through impure materials (electrons behave as both particles and waves), but under certain circumstances it can happen with other types of waves as well.\nEven after Anderson‚Äôs discovery, much about localization remained mysterious. Although researchers were able to prove that localization does indeed occur, they had a very limited ability to predict when and where it might happen. It was as if you were standing on one side of a room, expecting a sound wave to reach your ear, but it never did. Even if, after Anderson, you knew that the reason it didn‚Äôt was that it had localized somewhere on its way, you‚Äôd still like to figure out exactly where it had gone. And for decades, that‚Äôs what mathematicians and physicists struggled to explain.\nThis is where¬†Svitlana Mayboroda¬†comes in. Mayboroda, 36, is a mathematician at the University of Minnesota. Five years ago, she began to untangle the long-standing puzzle of localization. She came up with a mathematical formula called the ‚Äúlandscape function‚Äù that predicts exactly where waves will localize and what form they‚Äôll take when they do.\n‚ÄúYou want to know how to find these areas of localization,‚Äù Mayboroda said. ‚ÄúThe naive approach is difficult. The landscape function magically gives a way of doing it.‚Äù\nHer work began in the realm of pure mathematics, but unlike most mathematical advances, which might find a practical use after decades, if ever, her work is already being applied by physicists. In particular, LED lights ‚Äî or light-emitting diodes ‚Äî depend on the phenomenon of localization. They light up when electrons in a semiconducting material, having started out in a position of higher energy, get trapped (or ‚Äúlocalize‚Äù) in a position of lower energy and emit the difference as a photon of light. LEDs are still a work in progress: Engineers need to build LEDs that more efficiently convert electrons into light, if the devices are to become the future of artificial lighting, as many expect they will. If physicists can gain a better understanding of the mathematics of localization, engineers can build better LEDs ‚Äî and with the help of Mayboroda‚Äôs mathematics, that effort is already under way.\nRogue Waves\nLocalization is not an intuitive concept. Imagine you stood on one side of a room and watched someone ring a bell, only the sound never reached your ears. Now imagine that the reason it didn‚Äôt is that the sound had fallen into an architectural trap, like the sound of the sea bottled in a shell.\n"], ["author", "Quanta Magazine"], ["tags", "Mathematicians, LED"], ["created_at", "0012-03-13 00:00:00"], ["updated_at", "0011-02-14 00:00:00"]]
